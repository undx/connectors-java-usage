* component-runtime :: standalone :: demo using framework in full java

** standalone
This is a demo project for showing how to use component-runtime with a full java independent project.

Main trick for fixing classloader and injections issues relies on the =internal= package.

Inspired from =component-runtime-junit= module.

** Roadmap and potential enhancements
- move internals to a framework module.
- allow to specify more than one connector.
- add a default lookup for plugin artifact if jarLocation is not specified in =@WithConnector= annotation.
- as above with artifact specified in pom.
- handling =Job= like class making pipelines.
- add more convenience methods like =getInputIterator=.
- handle grpc data output.
- dockerize project maven goal.
- make a starter-toolkit template for Qlik eco-system.
